# ArgStone (Beta)
Forced Reasoning Super-Intelligence

Modern language models (LMs) have become increasingly prevalent, with their architecture heavily reliant on the Transformer network. This architecture allows these models to effectively predict the subsequent word in a sequence, a fundamental task in natural language processing. User-friendly language models, such as ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-r1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and achieved widespread adoption due to their ease of use and versatility. However, despite the effectiveness of these models in many applications, more advanced and intricate tasks often necessitate a higher degree of reasoning and cognitive processing. These complex problems can push the boundaries of current LM capabilities, requiring more sophisticated approaches to achieve satisfactory results. In response to these limitations, ArgStone has conceived a groundbreaking vision for the future of language models: a super-heavy model designed to overcome the challenges posed by advanced tasks. This innovative model will incorporate a unique internal debate mechanism that simulates a thorough reasoning process before generating a final answer. By engaging in this internal deliberation, the model can carefully analyse the nuances of a question, explore various perspectives, and weigh the evidence to arrive at a more informed and accurate response. This capability would enable the model to effectively tackle complex questions that go beyond the problem-solving abilities of humans, pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible with artificial intelligence.

What Are "Go Files"? The content of a Go file effectively captures the entire discussion and exchange between the two artificial intelligence systems. It serves as a detailed record, illustrating precisely how each AI processes information, weighs different perspectives, and ultimately arrives at its conclusions for a particular Version. The Go file provides a clear and comprehensive demonstration of the reasoning mechanisms employed by both AIs throughout their interaction, offering valuable insight into their cognitive processes.
